   <p>
    Parallax scrolling is a technique in computer graphics where background images 
    move past the camera more slowly than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D scene of distance.
    The technique
    grew out of the multiplane camera technique used in traditional animation since the 1930s.
    Parallax scrolling was popularized in 2D computer graphics with its introduction to video games in the early 1980s. 
    Some parallax scrolling was used in the arcade video game Jump Bug (1981).
    It used a limited form of parallax scrolling with the main scene scrolling while the starry night sky is fixed and 
    clouds move slowly, adding depth to the scenery. The following year, Moon Patrol (1982) implemented a full
    form of parallax scrolling, with three separate background layers scrolling at different speeds, simulating the
    distance between them. Moon Patrol is often credited with popularizing parallax scrolling.Jungle King (1982),
    later called Jungle Hunt, also had parallax scrolling,
    and was released a month after Moon Patrol in June 1982.<br><br>
